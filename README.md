# hitmanTokenizer42
* I decide to create a smart contract representing a **hitmanContract**

## Choice of BlockChain is Sepolia TestNet (Google)
* To deploy and make test i choose Sepolia because:
  1. It's free and easy to obtain Faucet for test (ETH for testing)
  2. Unlike BNB Chain i dont need to join a discord or pay 0.002 ETH ...
  3. It's an Ethereum BlockChain so there's a lot of Documentation

## Which Technology i used
* I used node package to manage and deploy my Smart Contract
* Two npm packages are known for that : Truffle and Hardhat package
  1. I choose Hardhat cause it implement a easy way to verify and publish Smart Contract

## Wallet Creation
* **Metamask.io**. Who else ?

## BlockChain navigator
* **Etherscan.io** Here too! Who else ?
